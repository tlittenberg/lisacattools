Python module for interacting with example LISA catalogs

## 1 - Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine,
either for development and testing purposes or as an installed package.  For more information, see the documentation at https://tlittenberg.github.io/lisacattools.

### 1.1 - Prerequisites

You will need python3 to run this program.

### 1.2 - Installing by cloning the repository

First, we need to clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tlittenberg/lisacattools.git
```

#### 1.2.1 - For users

To install the package for non-root users:

```bash
make user
```

To install the package on the root system:

```bash
make
```

#### 1.2.2 - For developers

Create a virtualenv

```bash
make prepare-dev
source ..venv
```

Install the sotfware and the external libraries for development purpose

```bash
make install-dev
```

### 1.3 - Installing by pip

```bash
pip install lisacattools
```

## 2 - Development (only if the repository has be cloned)

### 2.1 - Writing the code

Install the software by PIP (developers version)

Then, develop your code and commit

```bash
git commit
```

The tests and code style formatter will be run automatically. To ignore the
checks, do

```bash
git commit --no-verify
```

### 2.2 - Running the tests

```bash
make test
```

### 2.3 - Testing on python 3.8,3.9,3.10

Install all required prerequisite dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev \
libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm \
libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libxml2-dev libxmlsec1-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev

```

Download and execute installation script:
￼
```bash
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
```

Add the following entries into your ~/.bashrc file:

```bash
# pyenv
export PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init --path)"
eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"
```

Restart your shell:

```bash
exec $SHELL
```

Validate installation:

```bash
pyenv --version
```

Once the dependencies are installed, test on python 3.8, 3.8 and 3.10 :

```bash
make tox
```

## 3 - Running the tutorial

Once the software is installed, data must be downloaded for the tutorial.
The data are downloaded from a google drive and are large files -- ~10GB in total -- and will be installed
in `tutorial/data`.
Datasets include a catalog of simulated MBH detections with parameters updated on a weekly cadence,
and two UCB catalogs, using 3 and 6 months of simulated LISA data.

```bash
make data
```

Then install jupyter and run the tutorial

```bash
make demo
```
