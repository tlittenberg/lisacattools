Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}` for local development.

1. Fork the lisacattools repo on Gitlab.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:<your github id>/lisacattools.git

3. Install pyenv to test lisacattools with different versions of Python

    $ curl https://pyenv.run | bash
    $ echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
    $ echo 'eval "$(pyenv init --path)"' >> ~/.bashrc
    $ echo 'eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
    $ source ~/.bashrc
    $ pyenv install 3.10 3.11 3.12

4. Install Poetry â€” Python's Packaging and Dependency Manager

    $ curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3

5. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenv installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development::

    $ cd lisacattools
    $ make prepare-dev
    $ source .lisacattools
    $ make install-dev

6. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

7. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass the
   tests, including testing other Python versions with tox::

    $ make test
    $ make tox


8. Commit your changes and push your branch to Gitlab::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

9. Submit a pull request through the Github website.
